# A Tribute Page

Pen: https://codepen.io/erinisaac/pen/boRBOd.

First assignment set by freecodecamp.org is to create a tribute page. I chose Jordan Peterson because his online lectures helped me out of a deep hole in my life. It's not as altruistic as honoring someone world-changing like Dr. Norman Borlaug or M. Gandhi, but I wouldn't even be learning web development and trying to improve my life without this guy, and I figure this would be a nice way to show my appreciation.
