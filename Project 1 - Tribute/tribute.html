      <h3>A Timeline of Events</h3>
      <div id="timeline" class="text-left">
        <ul>
          <li><b>1962</b> - was born in Edmonton, Alberta.</li>
          <li><b>1975</b> - the school librarian introduced him to authors like Orwell, Solzhenitzyn, and Rand.</li>
          <li><b>1982</b> - received a BA in political science.</li>
          <li><b>1984</b> - after taking a year off to visit europe, where he became interested in mankind's capacity for evil during the 20th century (especially the cold war), he completed a BA in psychology.</li>
          <li><b>1993</b> - after receiving a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, he began working at Harvard as an associate professor.</li>
          <li><b>1997</b> - returned to Canada to be a professor of psychology at U of Toronto.</li>
          <li><b>2004</b> - a thirteen-part TV series was produced based on his book <em>Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief</em>, published five years previously.</li>
          <li><b>2014</b> - Peterson began to upload his university lectures to YouTube.</li>
          <li><b>2015</b> - the <em>Self Authoring</em> program, a writing exercise designed by a group of psychologists (including Peterson) to help the user create their ideal future and act toward it, is released.</li>
          <li><b>2016</b> - a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP3mSamRbYA" target="_blank">video</a> of Peterson and a group of students debating goes relatively viral, receiving 1.8 million views in one month. This is where I first heard of Peterson. Following this video, he then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wyGK6k6HE&t=5729s" target="_blank">appeared</a> on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where he made his aversion to Bill C-16 widely known. This was due to it's parallels with what he had found when studying evil and the cold war.</li>
          <li><b>2017</b> - due to his increasing popularity, more of the public find out about and watch his lectures. Peterson's lessons on cleaning your room, growing up, facing the unknown and <em>slaying the dragon</em> resonate with his viewers, especially with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njoBZ0PDkPE" target="_blank">young men</a>, he notes. For me, and for others, the teachings of his lectures and the guidance of the Self Authoring program have been life-saving.</li>
